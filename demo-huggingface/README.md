# ü´Å Hugging Face Demo ‚Äì Pneumonia Detection

This folder contains the code used to deploy the interactive pneumonia detection demo on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CristinaLA/pneumonia-detector)

The demo allows users to upload a chest X-ray and receive:
- A prediction (**Pneumonia** or **Normal**)
- A probability score
- A Grad-CAM heatmap highlighting relevant lung regions

The interface is built using **Gradio**, and the model is a simple CNN trained on the [Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gonzajl/neumona-x-rays-dataset).
